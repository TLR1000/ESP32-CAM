# ESP32-CAM
Working examples of my ESP32-CAM setup

Note:   
The documentation for the EloquentEsp32Cam library specifies that you need to use ESP32 Arduino core version 2.x. If you're using a different version of the core (like 1.x or 3.x), it could cause compilation errors or unexpected behavior, as some functions or features might differ between core versions.

How to check your current ESP32 core version:      
1. In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager.        
2. Search for "ESP32" in the search bar.          
3. In the installed ESP32 package, check which version you currently have installed. If it's not in the 2.x range, you will need to change it.
